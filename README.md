# Version Warning


This project is 2 years old. It was written with the release of Polymer 1.0. Since 2014-2015 a lot has changed! So with the release of Polymer 2.0 it will need a full rewrite with the new syntax and build process (Webpack, Progressive Web Apps, ES2015, ES2016 e.t.c)

Although it implements the basic concepts of the platform it will require a rewrite.

Thank you for your support and I'll keep you updated on the progress.
